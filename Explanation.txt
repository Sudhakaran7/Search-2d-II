Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an NxN matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

Input Description:
First line contains, N and target.(1<N,target<100).
Second line contains, NxN elements for matrix in a single line.

Output Description:
Print True or False.

Sample Input:
3 5
1 4 5 2 6 7 8 10 12

Sample Output:
True

Explanation:
The given matrix,
